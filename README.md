# Pathfinder
##### A pathfinder visualizer using pygame as the framework.

The goal of the project was to get familiar with a basic simulated workflow consisting of:

- Version Control in form of git and GitHub
- planned folder and class structure
- bug fixing
- feature implementation

Currently, at the start pygame draws a grid and the user is able to draw Start- and End-nodes, Wallnodes and is able to clear nodes.
By pressing spacebar, an animated A* pathfinding solution will be shown, blue indicating the found path. Pressing spacebar again will reset the grid in order to be usable again.

Controls :

Q : Start node
E : End node
Spacebar : start A*
Left-Click : Draws wall
Right-Click : clears Node
